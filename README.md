# Welcome to OptiTools Pro issue tracker! 👋

Your feedback helps us make the software better for everyone.

## 📌 Purpose

This issue tracker is here to:

- Collect bug reports from users.
- Gather feature requests and ideas.
- Track the status of ongoing work.
- Discuss improvements openly.

## 📝 How to Submit an Issue

1. Search first – Check the existing issues to avoid duplicates.
2. Use the templates – Choose the right template (Bug Report / Feature Request) so we can help you faster.
3. Be specific – Include:

- Steps to reproduce (if it’s a bug)
- Expected vs actual results

## ✅ Our Commitment

We’ll:

- Review all issues promptly.
- Label and triage them so you know the status.
- Communicate openly about progress and decisions.

## 📢 Code of Conduct

There are basic rules of conduct that should be followed at all times by everyone participating in the discussions. While this is generally a relaxed environment, please remember the following:

- Do not insult, harass, or demean anyone.
- Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.
- Do not use ALL CAPS when creating an issue report.
- Do not repeatedly update an open issue remarking that the issue persists.

Remember: Just because the issue you reported was reported here does not mean that it is an issue with OptiTools. Also, should your issue not be resolved immediately, it does not mean that a resolution is not being researched or tested. Patience is always appreciated.

## 💡 Tips

If your problem is urgent or involves sensitive data, do not post it here — contact us through our private support channel instead.

Feature requests are more likely to be accepted if they include a clear use case and benefits for the wider community.

## Thanks for helping improve the project! 🚀
